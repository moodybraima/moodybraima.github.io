            <p>My name is Mahmoud A. M. Braima.</p>

            <p>I was trained in journalism and worked as a journalist. In graduate school, I added applied statistics to my journalism education. I became a journalism educator and did empirical research in my field with a focus on political communication.</p>

            <p>Besides proficiency in journalism and applied statistics, I am also fluent in Arabic and I speak basic French.</p>

            <p>I am going to work hard for the next two years to develop proficiency in coding then focus on analytics to take advantage of my newly acquired skills in coding and combine them with applied statistics to become an expert in analytics using both JavaScript and Python.</p>

            <p>Well, for now, check out these projects that I developed during the first part of my coding course, which focused on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, including PacMen Factory, Eye Movements and Real Time Bus Tracking.</p>
